# HAILEY


I solve problems from Codeforces, SPOJ, UVA and books which I find interesting.
My focus is mostly on algorithms - dynamic programming, sorting, greedy and strings.

Some problems might have very random logic but the work fine. i working daily to get better at it.
targeting 1500 problems by the end of 2019.

I don't have any particular motivation just love solving problems.``
